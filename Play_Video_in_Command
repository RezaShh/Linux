The syntax to open any file in its default application is

xdg-open <file_name>

If you want to have some fun and play the video in the terminal itself, install mplayer (sudo apt-get install mplayer) and run

mplayer -vo caca <movie_file>

It doesn't run directly in the terminal window, but it does display in ASCII characters.
